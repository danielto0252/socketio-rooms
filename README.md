Socket-io Rooms
===============

This is a basic node js web app that experiments with socket-io. There are only 2 pages: an /index and /receive. To use and download the app, just clone the files to your computer, go to the directory and type in "node app.js". After doing so, pull up both the /index and /receive pages in different tabs or windows. 

To use the app, you must first "join" a room in the /receive page. The room could either numbers, letters, or a combination of both; you just have to be consistent. Once you join from the receive page you can go to the index page, type the same room info into the top textbox, type an accompanying message and press send!

If all goes well (both clients are connected to the same room) the data will be shown in the receivers textarea! You can then experiment with multiple rooms and switching rooms using multiple clients.

Enjoy!!
